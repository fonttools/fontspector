        According to the OpenType spec:

        The value of unitsPerEm at the head table must be a value
        between 16 and 16384. Any value in this range is valid.

        In fonts that have TrueType outlines, a power of 2 is recommended
        as this allows performance optimizations in some rasterizers.

        But 1000 is a commonly used value. And 2000 may become
        increasingly more common on Variable Fonts.
