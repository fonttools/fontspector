        An old FontLab version had a bug which caused it to store copyright notices

        In order to detect those and distinguish them from actual legitimate usage of
        this name table entry, we expect that such strings do not exceed a reasonable
        length of 200 chars.

        Longer strings are likely instances of the FontLab bug.
